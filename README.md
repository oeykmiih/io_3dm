## About The Project

> Based on the wonderful work of [jesterKing](https://github.com/jesterKing), the original addon: [import-3dm](https://github.com/jesterKing/import_3dm)
>
> [BlenderBIM](https://github.com/IfcOpenShell/IfcOpenShell) also served as coding reference, as well as inspiration to start this in the first place, more freedom to the architecture industry!

This add-on uses the `rhino3dm.py` module (https://github.com/mcneel/rhino3dm) to read in 3dm files.

I am by no means a developer, just an architecture student who happened to be curious about programming; so if you have any suggestions, tips and tricks feel free to share!

I will try to maintain it as i go, but if a proper dev wants to take over, please do!

### Features

- imports 3dm files (not all types yet!)
  - cameras
  - objects
  - blocks
  - materials
- reloads 3dm files (in a somewhat crude way but allows for geometry refresh for renders!)

### Prerequisites

Works with Blender 3.6 and later (not tested in other versions)
